\paragraph*{1: Trying SGD}
Code the basic stochastic gradient algorithm with a (small) fixed step
size for the cricket chirp least squares fit from the June 13 lecture.
Draw two plots:
\begin{itemize}
\item Starting from a zero initial guess, plot the optimality gap (the
  true smallest squared residual vs.~the SGD squared residual)
  against the number of steps.
\item For different values of $\alpha$, run SGD for $10^5$ steps
  starting from the true solution and show a histogram of the
  optimality gap.  Also plot the mean optimality gap as a function of
  $\alpha$; ideally, the two should be proportional.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{2: Randomized scaling}
For $A \in \bbR^{m \times n}$, consider the iteration
\[
  x^{k+1} = x^k - \hat{G}^{-1} A^T (Ax^k - b).
\]
Here, $\hat{G}$ is an unbiased estimator for the Gram matrix $A^T A$,
defined by randomly choosing a subset of at least $n$ indices
$\mathcal{I}$:
\[
  \hat{G} =
  \frac{m}{|\mathcal{I}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} A_{i,:}^T A_{i,:}
\]
where $A_{i,:}$ representing row $i$ of $A$.  Define
$\rho(\hat{G}) = \|I-\alpha_{\mathrm{opt}} \hat{G}^{-1} A^T A\|$ to be
the rate of convergence for gradient descent with an optimal
step size.  For the cricket data least squares problem,
what is $\log \rho(I)$?  Compare to a histogram of
$\log \rho(\hat{G})$ for a few different sample sizes $|\mathcal{I}|$.

\paragraph*{3: Gauss-Newton}
Code the Gauss-Newton iteration to minimize
\[
  \phi(x) = \sum_j \exp(r_j^2)-1, \quad r = Ax-b,
\]
and illustrate the behavior for the cricket data.
