\paragraph*{1: Minimal norm}
Show how to find the solution to an underdetermined system
$Ax = b$ where $A \in \bbR^{m \times n}$ with $m < n$ such
that $x^T M x$ is minimal.

\paragraph*{2: An overfitting example}
In the class repository, you will find codes that compute
a polynomial approximation to $\sin(6x)$.  The codes are called
{\tt hw/code/overfit\_ex.m} and {\tt hw/code/chebmatrix.m};
they are written to work with MATLAB or Octave, but you may
translate them to whatever language you would like.  Run the code
for a few values of $m$, $n$, and $\sigma$; what do you see?
Write code to regularize with truncated SVD and with Tikhonov
regularization, and show plots to illustrate that it has the
desired effect.
