\paragraph*{1: HALS-RRI}
Implement the RRI iteration and write a test that illustrates
that it works correctly.

\paragraph*{2: Testing completion}
Fill in the {\tt test\_svdt.m} function from the repository with
MATLAB code for the thresholded SVD iteration.  If you prefer to
use some other language, you may translate the code.  At the end of the
iteration, is the reconstructed low-rank $\hat{A}$ a good
approximation to the true $A$?

\paragraph*{3: Completion via ALS}
Using the same framework as {\tt test\_svdt.m}, write a function
{\tt test\_als.m} to run the alternating least squares version
of matrix completion.
