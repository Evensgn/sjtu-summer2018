\paragraph*{1: Least squares Lebesgue}
Consider again the Chebyshev fitting problem
\[
  \hat{f}(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j T_j(x)
\]
where $c_j$ is chosen to minimize $\|Ac-f_X\|^2$ where $a_{ij} = T_j(x_i)$.
Argue that the Lebesgue constant for this problem is at most
$n \|A^\dagger\|_\infty$.  On a semi-logarithmic plot,
show $n \|A^\dagger\|_\infty$ versus $n$ for the case of $n$ evenly
spaced grid points in the interval $[-1,1]$ and $n = km$ for
$k = 1, 2, 3$.

\paragraph*{2: Splines}
For 10 points evenly spaced in $[-1,1]$, set up the cubic spline
system in the form described at the end of the notes from 6/26 to
approximate $f(x) = \sin(2\pi x)$, and plot the approximation error.
