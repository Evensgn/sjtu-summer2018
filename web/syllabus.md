## Course description

This is a survey course on numerical methods prominent in modern
data analysis and machine learning.  Building on basic methods
of optimization and numerical linear algebra, the course will
explore the role of numerical methods for treating several
classes of data analysis problems, including low rank
factorizations and completion of matrix data; function
approximation by kernel methods; and analysis of data on graphs.
The course is organized around four one-week units:

 - Optimization basics
 - Matrix data and latent factor models
 - Kernel interpolation and Gaussian processes
 - Numerical methods for graph data analysis
 
Students should know basic programming and should have prior courses
on linear algebra and multivariable calculus.  Familiarity with
numerical methods or machine learning will be useful, but not
required.

### Course materials

There is no textbook, but course notes will be posted on the web site
prior to each lecture.

### Course work

The course will be graded on the basis of weekly homework sets,
posted each Monday and due on Friday.
Students should also read the course notes and reply to a short set of
(ungraded) questions on the reading before each lecture.
