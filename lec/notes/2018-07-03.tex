\section{Graphs and linear algebra}

Formally, an unweighted graph is
$\calG = (\calV, \calE)$,
where $\calE \subset \calV \times \calV$.
Informally, $\calV$ consists of things we want to model and $\calE$
represents the relations between them.
It is a very flexible representation: we use graphs to represent
friendships between people, wires between routers, citations between
papers, links between objects in a data structure, and many other things.
When the bare topology of the relationships does not provide enough
modeling power, we might also consider including functions on
$\mathcal{V}$ or $\mathcal{E}$ corresponding to different attributes.
The most common case is a scalar {\em weight} function
assigned to each edge that corresponds to the importance of the
relation: in a social network, for example, maybe a close and
active friendship has more weight than a casual acquaintance.
